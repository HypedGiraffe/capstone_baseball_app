# Capstone Project - Baseball Modeling and Forecasting Application

## Problem Statement

### Guide of This Repository

Code - Here you will find every notebook used to create the final version of the baseball prediction app.
  1. - Aquiring Pitcher Data - Used to get season by season data and career aggregate data for pitchers
  2. - Aquiring Batter Data  - Used to get season by season data and career aggregate data for batters
  3. - EDA - Plotting and examining example variables from pitching data
  4. - Individual Career Data - Used to aquire individual dataframes for pitchers and batters, season by season
  5. - Streamlit - File used to run the App, carrying out modeling and forecasting
 
Data - Career aggregate data for batters and pitchers, used for modeling and predicting

Indvid_Data - Season by season data for indvidual pitchers and batters, used for forecasting

Deliverables - An executive summary of the project, as well as a technical analysis

Slides - 
  
## Your Deliverables

- A well-made predictive model using either structured or unstructured machine learning techniques (or other technique approved in advanced by the instructors), as well as clean, well-written code.
- A technical report aimed at fellow data scientists that explains your process and findings.
- A public presentation of your findings aimed primarily at laypeople.



Below are some great capstone projects submitted by past DSI students!

* [Kenya Chauche, DSI-10](https://github.com/KenyaChauche/sonnet-generation) built a natural language generation program trained on Shakespeare's sonnets
* [Molly Baird, DSI-11](https://github.com/mollycbaird/ComputerVisionSET) wanted to computerize the game of SET, and succeeded admirably
* [Daniel Johnston, DSI-2](https://github.com/djkjohnston/ML_from_scratch_GA_DSI_Capstone) built several key machine learning algos from scratch in python, comparing their performance to the scikit-learn implementations.  
* [Alex Schultz, DSI-3](https://github.com/fullquartpress/DSI-Capstone) predicts spot coffee (commodity coffee bean) price changes from sentiment analysis of an industry trade publication.  
* [Brice Walker, DSI-3](https://github.com/bricewalker/Hey-Jetson) wanted to play with his Jetson GPU and built voice transcription _from scratch_.  
* [Caitlin Streamer, DSI-4](https://github.com/c-streams/Pneumonia) worked on a Kaggle dataset to predict pneumonia from chest X-rays.  
* [Brian Osgood, DSI-04](https://github.com/osgoodbl/PyFilter) built a bot that crawls twitter and identifies whether an image tagged 'lamborghini' is actually a lamborghini.  
* [Frank Turner, DSI-04](https://github.com/frankturnerv/Fashioning_Models_from_Fashion_Models) uses image recognition to identify the colors used in a fashion season's palette.  
* [DSI-06, team](https://github.com/balak4/Optimizing-Evac-Routes) This is actually the DSI-6 group project. It's here because it's really, really impressive.  
* [Amy Taylor, DSI-06](https://github.com/amytaylor330/CNN_for_Dance_Music_Classification_repost) wanted to quantify the difference between types of dance music.  
* [Veronica Giannotta, DSI-06](https://github.com/vgiannotta/Emotional-Impacts-of-Viral-Content) delved into the dark side of the internet and evaluated the emotional sentiment of social media content that goes viral.
* [Derek Steffan, DSI-07](https://github.com/dsteffan/twitch_chat_analysis) automates the process of creating twitch highlight reels using sentiment analysis, markov chains, and Bayesian analysis.  
* [Sebastian Alvis, League of Legends](https://github.com/salvis2/SpringboardAlvis/tree/master/capstone_project_1) Not a GA capstone, but a very compelling case for applying data science to your interests to come up with a good capstone.
